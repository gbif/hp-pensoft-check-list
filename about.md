This is а GBIF Hosted Portal, displaying data extracted or associated with articles published in [Check List](https://checklist.pensoft.net/).

**Check List** is a peer-reviewed online journal, devoted to publishing biodiversity data related to species’ geographic distributions. Thus, our primary mission is to fill the so-called Wallacean shortfall (Lomolino 2004) and to improve our knowledge of how life is distributed on the planet in order to better preserve it. These data are essential for studies on biogeography and provide a baseline for the conservation of biodiversity. The first step to undertaking effective conservation action is to maintain records of the distribution of species.

Therefore, the journal was created from the need to publish basic data on species' distributions of any taxon in a timely and open manner, which are often neglected by traditional journals.

**Check List** is a bimonthly peer-reviewed online journal, and will consider for publication:

* Annotated list of species, of a given supraspecific taxon in a strict geographic area, with comments on the identifications and figures of most or all species. ALS must be based on original data. We no longer publish papers based solely on literature compilations.
* Notes on the geographic distribution, reporting new records of one or more species while providing a complete overview on the known distribution of the treated taxa.
